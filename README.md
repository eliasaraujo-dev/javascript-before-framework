# 📘 javascript-before-framework

This repository is dedicated to my studies of pure JavaScript before diving into any frameworks. The goal is to master the core of the language, understanding fundamental and advanced concepts — essential for any frontend developer aiming to write efficient, clean, and scalable code.

## 🧠 Why learn plain JavaScript first?

Before jumping into frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, it's crucial to understand how JavaScript works under the hood. This repository serves as a solid foundation to:

- Understand JavaScript core mechanics;
- Feel confident debugging and solving problems;
- Know **when to use a framework** and **when vanilla JavaScript is enough**;
- Write cleaner, faster, and reusable code.
